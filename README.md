# Color_detection_usingOpenCV
This Project uses OPENCV llibrary and detects colour of the provided image.
It can detect colours in realtime images [usingWebcam].
This model analyzes an image anad using histogram shows a graph of frequency of pixels present in that image.

DATASET:

##Uses the "color.csv" file to read colors.
Colors are made up of 3 primary colors; red, green, and blue. In computers, we define each color value within a range of 0 to 255. So in how many ways we can define a color? The answer is 256*256*256 = 16,581,375. There are approximately 16.5 million different ways to represent a color.
